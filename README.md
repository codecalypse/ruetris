# Ruetris
Ruetris is the machine learning enviroment developed for my master thesis. This enviroment is in the src-folder.
This repository consists of not only the enviroment, instead, provides networks for reinforcement learning, agents,
training routines, manual mode, test routines and evaluated data from my thesis. The thesis itself is also contained, but 
is currently only available in german (I have in mind to translate the work later on). The videos linked in the thesis are
on youtube, so if someone is interested in only visual results, here is the link:

The simulation application showed on youtube and in thesis is not in the repository, because it is not my property. Enything else 
I did in my sparetime and shall be provided under the MIT lizenz to everyone, maybe someone can find it usefull.
At the end I want to mention, that this was my very first time doing something with neuronal networks and creating something 
bigger as simple functions, so please be indulgent and hold that in mind. Neverless I enjoyed the challange.
